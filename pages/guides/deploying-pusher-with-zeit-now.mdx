WebSockets have enabled realtime online experiences like collaborative document editing, multiplayer games, and interactive chatrooms. Solutions such as [socket.io](https://socket.io) have made writing WebSocket servers a breeze, but what if our backend is a serverless lambda function with limited execution times?

By design, serverless functions have maximum execution limits and should aim to respond to the client as quick as possible. An open WebSocket connection would require processes to live until the connection is closed, which can be well over the maximum execution time. Solutions like [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels) solve complex realtime infrastructure problems so you donâ€™t have to. All you need is a single serverless function to _publish_ or _push_ some data, and a client to _subscribe_ to channels and data events.

This guide demonstrates how to get started creating and deploying real-time serverless applications with framework agnostic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Pusher, and Now. <Note>This guide will not be a full code walkthrough, but rather an overview of the key pieces. Please refer to the full source code linked at the bottom of the guide to see how everything fits together.</Note>

## Step 1: Pusher Account Setup

Let's start by making an account on [Pusher](https://dashboard.pusher.com/accounts/sign_up) and creating a new app. Locate the _Create new app_ button on the left sidebar.

Next, we'll give our app a name and select a region. Choose a region closest to the majority of your customers to minimize latency.

<Image

  width={650}

From your dashboard, you can scroll down to find all of your pusher apps. Locate the one you just created and click on it.

<Image

  width={650}
  height={380}
  oversize
/>

Finally, click on the tab that reveals your App Keys. We need to copy these values so that we can save them as secrets and then pass them as environmental variables.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Project

Now that we have our Pusher account and app set up, let's create our directory structure. All we need is a root directory where our static files (HTML, CSS, JS) will live and an `api` directory with our lambda functions. Create a new directory named <InlineCode>realtime-lambda</InlineCode> and in it, create a directory named <InlineCode>api</InlineCode>. Then enter your newly created directory.

<Snippet dark text="mkdir -p realtime-lambda/api && cd realtime-lambda" />

With our directory set up, create an <InlineCode>index.html</InlineCode> file and add the script tags below inside the <InlineCode>body</InlineCode>.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://js.pusher.com/4.4/pusher.min.js"></script>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<Caption>
  Adding <InlineCode>script</InlineCode> tags inside the{' '}
  <InlineCode>body</InlineCode>of our<InlineCode>index.html</InlineCode>
</Caption>

We want to create an instance of a Pusher client that subscribes and reacts to events on the appropriate channel. We also want to send data to our lambda that will trigger a push event.

Create a <InlineCode>main.js</InlineCode> file where we'll initialize a Pusher object with our app key and an object containing our cluster info.

<Note>
  Our app key will be exposed on the client, but that's fine since we need to
  combine it with a secret in order to push anything. We'll do that later in our
  lambda function by passing it through an environmental variable.
</Note>

With our object, we'll subscribe to the appropriate channel and bind a callback function to react to our events within that channel. We can subscribe to as many channels and bind callbacks to as many events as we need.

```js
// initialize Pusher client
let pusher = new Pusher('app-key', {
  cluster: 'cluster-region'
})

// subscribe to the appropriate channel channel
let channel = pusher.subscribe('channel-name')

// bind a callback function to an event within the channel
channel.bind('event-name', function(data) {
  // do stuff with data
})
```

<Caption>

  binding to an event
</Caption>

All that's remaining on the client is to create a way to send data to our backend to trigger push events. We just need to send a <InlineCode>POST</InlineCode> request to our lambda and can do so with the native [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). By wrapping our request in a function, we can re-use it whenever we need to send data. Add the snippet below to your <InlineCode>main.js</InlineCode> file.

<Note>
  We haven't created our lambda function yet, but its good to mention that
  routing follows the filesystem convention by default. All that's needed to
  create a valid route for the path we are requesting, is to create a file named{' '}
  <InlineCode>pusher-lambda.js</InlineCode> in our <InlineCode>api</InlineCode>{' '}
  directory and it'll be invoked when we send a request to{' '}
  <InlineCode>/api/pusher-lambda</InlineCode>.
</Note>

```js
async function pushData(data) {
  const res = await fetch('/api/pusher-lambda', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  })
  if (!res.ok) {
    console.error('failed to push data')
  }
}
```

<Caption>

  <InlineCode>api</InlineCode>endpoint
</Caption>

Before we move over to our lambda, we need to first add the appropriate [secrets](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/build-step#using-environment-variables-and-secrets) to our account and expose them as environmental variables. We can do so with the [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download). Since the app key and cluster are already exposed on the client and they are not sensitive, we don't need to add them as secrets. We'll only add our _app id_ and our _app secret_.

<Snippet dark text={`now secrets add pusher-app-id "***"`} />
<Snippet dark text={`now secrets add pusher-app-secret "***"`} />

Next, create a minimal <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file with environment variables to expose the secrets you added to your account.

<Note>
  We can pass unencrypted environment variables as plain text and encrypted
  values stored in our account with the <InlineCode>@</InlineCode> prefix.
</Note>

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "env": {
    "APP_ID": "@pusher-app-id",
    "KEY": "app-key",
    "SECRET": "@pusher-ap-secret",
    "CLUSTER": "cluster-region"
  }
}
```

Add the dependencies for the serverless function from inside the <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory.

<Snippet dark text="cd api && npm i pusher" />
<Caption>Entering the `/api` directory and installing the `pusher` npm package</Caption>

Create a <InlineCode>pusher-lambda.js</InlineCode> inside the <InlineCode>/api</InlineCode> directory that initializes a new Pusher object with the environmental variables and receives data from the [`req.body` helper method](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages/#node.js-request-and-response-objects), before invoking [`pusher.trigger`](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-node#publishing-events) to register the event. Then we pull the data that we sent to our lambda via the [req.body](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/serverless-functions/supported-languages/#node.js-request-and-response-objects) helper method and invoke [pusher.trigger](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-node#publishing-events) with it in addition to the channel name and the event name. We need to send a status code and a response for the lambda or else our application would return an error, so we can just chain [req.status](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-node#publishing-events) and [req.end](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-node#publishing-events) with a simple success message

```js
const Pusher = require('pusher')

const {
  APP_ID: appId,
  KEY: key,
  SECRET: secret,
  CLUSTER: cluster
} = process.env

const pusher = new Pusher({
  appId,
  key,
  secret,
  cluster
})

module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body
  pusher.trigger('event-channel', 'event-name', data)
  res.status(200).end('sent event succesfully')
}
```

<Caption>`pusher-lambda.js` file inside of `/api` directory</Caption>

When <InlineCode>pusher.trigger</InlineCode> is called, an event will be broadcasted to all subscribed clients. That's all there is to wire everything up. We've created a more complete demo with these concepts [here](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples/pull/468). Take a look, hack around, and give us your feedback.
