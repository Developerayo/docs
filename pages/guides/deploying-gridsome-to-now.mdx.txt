Gridsome is an open source vue.js site generator which gives developers the power to build beautiful JAMstack apps and Progressive Web Apps that are fast and scailable.

In this guide, we will cover how to deploy a Gridsome app with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Gridsome Project

First, set up a Gridsome project using the [official Gridsome CLI](https://gridsome.org/docs).

If you do not have the Gridsome CLI installed globally on your system, use the following command to install it globally:

<Snippet dark text="npm i -g @gridsome/cli" />

After the installation is successful, create a new project and `cd` into the project folder. Use the following command below in your system terminal to do so:

<Snippet dark text="gridsome create gridsome-project && cd gridsome-project" />

Gridsome Starter project will successfully clone `gridsome-starter-default`

The Gridsome CLI installs all the required dependencies and provisions a new project for you.

Next, to extend the project with client-side routing; create a `.vue` components inside the `/pages` folder to create pages routes, you can use `gridsome build` to generate static files in a `/dist` folder

## Step 2: Deploying with Now

With your project set up, you are ready to deploy your Gridsome app with [Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

You can deploy your Gridsome app with **just a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

Once the app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL similar to the following: <https://gridsome-project-ro3oxryae.now.sh/>
