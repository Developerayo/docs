[Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) is an open source Vue.js site generator which gives developers the power to build apps that are fast by default.

In this guide, we will cover how to deploy a Gridsome app with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Gridsome Project

First, set up a Gridsome project using the [official Gridsome CLI](https://gridsome.org/docs).

If you do not have the Gridsome CLI installed globally on your system, use the following command to install it globally:

<Snippet dark text="npm i -g @gridsome/cli" />

After the installation is successful, create a new project and `cd` into the project folder. Use the following command below in your system terminal to do so:

<Snippet dark text="gridsome create gridsome-project && cd gridsome-project" />

Gridsome Starter project will successfully clone `gridsome-starter-default`



## Step 2: Deploying with ZEIT Now

With your project set up, you are ready to deploy your Gridsome app with [Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

You can deploy your Gridsome app with **just a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Gridsome project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
